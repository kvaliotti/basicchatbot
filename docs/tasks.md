# Chatapp Development Tasks

## Current Task: Multi-Mode Chat with Recommendations âœ…

### Requirements COMPLETED
1. **Mode Selection Dropdown** âœ…
   - Dropdown with "General" and "Research Article Reviewer" options
   - Dynamic UI changes based on selected mode
   - Clear mode switching with conversation reset

2. **System Prompt Differentiation** âœ…
   - **General Mode**: Expert consultant discussion (McKinsey, BCG, Bain format)
   - **Research Reviewer Mode**: Academic analysis with structured recommendations

3. **Research Article Reviewer Features** âœ…
   - Structured analysis format (Key Findings, Methodology, Critical Assessment)
   - Explicit next-step recommendations generation
   - Works optimally with PDF uploads but also handles text input

4. **Recommendations Sidebar** âœ…
   - Automatic extraction of recommendations from LLM responses
   - Sidebar display only in Research Reviewer mode
   - Accumulation of recommendations throughout conversation
   - Clear and manage recommendations functionality

### Technical Implementation âœ…
- **Frontend Components**:
  - [x] ModeSelector dropdown component
  - [x] RecommendationsSidebar component
  - [x] Updated ChatInterface with mode-aware layout
  - [x] Full-screen layout with responsive sidebar

- **Backend Integration**:
  - [x] Extended ChatRequest schema with chat_mode parameter
  - [x] Mode-specific system prompts in OpenAI service
  - [x] Research reviewer prompt with structured analysis format

- **State Management**:
  - [x] Extended ChatContext for mode and recommendations
  - [x] Recommendation extraction and storage
  - [x] Conversation clearing on mode switch

- **Type Safety**:
  - [x] TypeScript types for ChatMode and Recommendation
  - [x] Proper interface definitions across frontend/backend

### Acceptance Criteria âœ…
- [x] User can select between "General" and "Research Article Reviewer" modes via dropdown
- [x] General mode uses existing expert consultant system prompt
- [x] Research reviewer mode uses new academic analysis system prompt
- [x] Research mode automatically extracts and displays recommendations in sidebar
- [x] Recommendations accumulate as conversation continues
- [x] PDF integration works with both modes
- [x] UI adapts appropriately to selected mode (titles, placeholders, sidebar visibility)
- [x] Mode switching resets conversation for clean context
- [x] Responsive design works across different screen sizes

### Technical Stack Enhancements
- Frontend: React with TypeScript (enhanced)
- Backend: FastAPI with Python (enhanced with mode support)
- Database: PostgreSQL (unchanged)
- AI: OpenAI API integration with dual system prompts
- New: Pattern-based recommendation extraction
- New: Mode-aware UI components

## Previous Task: RAG PDF Chat Feature âœ…

### Requirements COMPLETED
1. **Frontend (React)** âœ…
   - Input field at the top for OpenAI API key
   - Chat interface for AI interaction
   - Message display and input components
   - PDF upload and management interface

2. **Backend (FastAPI)** âœ…
   - RESTful API endpoints for chat functionality
   - OpenAI integration with custom system prompt
   - Database operations for message persistence
   - PDF processing and vector database endpoints

3. **Database (PostgreSQL)** âœ…
   - User credentials: myuser:mypassword
   - Tables for conversations and messages
   - Database connection and models

4. **AI Integration** âœ…
   - System prompt: Mixture of experts (McKinsey, BCG, Bain consultants)
   - Expert discussion simulation before providing answer
   - OpenAI API integration
