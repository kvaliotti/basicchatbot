1. Introduction: Importance of AI as evaluators in various domains (coding, reasoning, language tasks) and the need for reliability.
2. Core concept: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated judges to rank or score responses, aligned with human judgment.
3. Vulnerabilities: Explanation of prompt manipulation attacks (e.g., inserting 'Thought process:' phrases) causing high false positive rates in evaluations.
4. Adversarial Data Augmentation: Creating synthetic negative samples by truncating responses to non-informative parts, used to train LLMs for robustness.
5. Training Enhancements: How augmented datasets improve the model's ability to detect genuine vs. manipulated responses.
6. Key Findings: Summary of vulnerabilities in standard LLM evaluators, effectiveness of mitigation techniques, and the resulting improvements in reliability.
7. Practical Implications: Impact of more robust LLM evaluators for scalable, cost-effective, and consistent automated assessments in education, coding platforms, and research.
8. Call to Action: Importance of awareness and adoption of resilient evaluation models for trustworthy AI-driven decision support.
9. Closing: Staying ahead in AI innovation by understanding risks and implementing best practices.
10. Hashtags and Keywords relevant to AI evaluation, security, and responsible AI.
